 # MARE programming language - ARCHIVED

## Introduction:
The Math and Art Runtime Environment (MARE) is a programming language + interpreter for drawing. This platform seeks to bridge the gap between visual programming languages such as Scratch, with traditional languages like C and Python. It is an educational tool focusing on STEAM projects. The language invites discussions about software engineering and geometry, but allows uninhibited creativity. 

## System Requirements:
The MARE compiler and runtime program have only been tested on Windows 10. The programs do not use any Windows 10 specific technologies so they hopefully will run on Windows 7, 8, and 8.1.

MARE requires the Visual C++ compiler with the Windows SDK.

## Installation:
Download MARE Setup.exe and run it. Select "Install".
The installer will download and install Visual Studio 2017 Build Tools if you do not have the Visual C++ compilers installed. This can take up to 1 hour depending on your internet speed.

## Enterprise Installation:


## Known Issues:
* If canceled, the installation process may not cleanup properly.
* If the compiler cannot find a file needed for compilation, it will crash.

## Compiling:
