MARE programming language.

Introduction:
The Math and Art Runtime Environment is meant to bridge the gap between visual programming, like MIT's Scratch, and complex languages like C and Python.



System Requirements:
The MARE compiler and runtime program have only been tested on Windows 10. The programs do not use any Windows 10 specific technologies so they hopefully will run on Windows 7, 8, and 8.1.
